BFS is an algorithm used to explore and traverse all the nodes of a graph starting from a given source node in a breadth-first manner, i.e., it visits all the nodes at the same level before moving deeper into the graph.

Let's break down the code step by step:

The function bfsOfGraph takes two parameters:

V: An integer representing the number of vertices in the graph.
adj: A vector array representing the adjacency list of the graph. Each element of this vector array holds a list of integers representing the vertices adjacent to the corresponding vertex.
It initializes an empty vector res to store the BFS traversal result, i.e., the order in which nodes are visited during BFS.

It initializes a vector vst of size V, which is used to keep track of visited nodes during the traversal. All elements are initialized to false, indicating that no node has been visited yet.

The starting node for the BFS traversal is the vertex with index 0. Therefore, it sets vst[0] to true to mark it as visited and adds it to the result vector res.

Two variables i and n are declared and initialized to 0. These variables are used to control the traversal process.

The outer while loop continues as long as the size of the result vector res is not equal to n. The initial size of res is 1 (since the starting node is added), so this loop will run until all nodes are visited and added to the result vector.

Inside the outer loop, there is an inner while loop, which processes the nodes at the current level. The inner loop runs as long as i is less than n, where n represents the number of nodes at the current level.

Within the inner loop, it iterates through the adjacency list of the node at index i in the result vector res. It uses the adj array to get the list of adjacent nodes for the current node.

For each adjacent node u, it checks if it has not been visited (!vst[u]). If the node has not been visited, it marks it as visited (vst[u] = 1) and adds it to the result vector res. This step ensures that each node is added to the result vector only once and prevents cycles in the traversal.

After processing all the nodes at the current level, it increments i to move to the next level.

The while loop continues until all nodes are visited, and the result vector res contains the BFS traversal of the graph.

Finally, it returns the BFS traversal result vector res.

The BFS traversal starts from the first vertex (index 0) and explores the graph level by level, visiting all its neighbors before moving on to the next level. This ensures that nodes closer to the starting node are visited before nodes farther away, producing the breadth-first order of traversal.
